# Using the React-with-Redux project template (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> The existing .NET Core 2.0.x SDK includes a React-with-Redux project template. **This documentation is not about the existing React-with-Redux project template.** This documentation is about the next version of the React-with-Redux template which we will ship in early 2018.

The updated React-with-Redux project template provides a convenient starting point for ASP.NET Core applications using React, Redux, and *create-react-app* (CRA) conventions to implement a rich client-side user interface (UI).

All information about the React-with-Redux template is the same as for the React template, except that when creating the project, you should use the command `dotnet new reactredux` instead of `dotnet new react`. For more information about the functionality common to both React-based templates, see [React template documentation](xref:spa/react).
