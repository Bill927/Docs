# Using the Single-Page Application templates (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> The existing .NET Core 2.0.x SDK includes project templates for Angular, React, and React with Redux. **This documentation is not about those existing project templates.** This documentation is about the next version of the Angular/React/React+Redux templates which we will ship in early 2018.

## Prerequisites

* [ASP.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/) SDK, version 2.0.0 or later
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), version 6 or later

## Installation

To install the **preview** release of the ASP.NET Core templates for Angular, React, and React with Redux, run the following in a command prompt:

    dotnet new --install Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates::2.0.1-preview1

**TODO** Update the line above to reflect the final preview1 package name before publishing these docs.

## Using the templates

- [Using the Angular project template](xref:spa/angular)
- [Using the React project template](xref:spa/react)
